# lecture.js

A themeable, markdown based, slideshow tool.

Still in its early stages. Lots of functionalities are missing so use at your own risk.

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:arestivo/lecture.js.git
cd lecture.js
npm install
npm run less
ts-node src/lecture.ts markdown/lecture.md --theme plain
```

## Themes

Currently only two themes exist: plain and default

## Demo

A demo can be found [here](https://arestivo.github.io/lecture.js/).
